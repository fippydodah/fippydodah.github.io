                    <p>
                        I am currently an undergraduate student at Texas Christian University,
                        where I am majoring in
                        Computer Information Technology. I have a deep passion for innovation and a keen interest in the
                        rapidly evolving
                        technology industry.

                        In my free time, I love spending time outdoors, whether it's skiing, hiking, camping, playing
                        tennis, or golfing. I
                        believe that maintaining a balanced lifestyle, which includes taking care of both mental and
                        physical health, is the key
                        to success.

                        Beyond my hobbies, I am always eager to learn from professionals in the computer science field
                        and absorb everything I
                        can from my classes at TCU. I have enjoyed exploring AI development, software development,
                        cybersecurity, and IT. I
                        look forward to continuing to grow in these areas both inside and outside of school.

                        Thank you for visiting my website. Please take a moment to look at some of the certifications
                        and projects I have
                        completed. Don’t miss the contact form at the bottom—I’d love to hear from you!

                        <h3>Local LLM Voice Assistant</h3>
                        <p>
                            I made a voice assistant that can operate offline. I personally feel unsettled having a
                            voice assistant such as Alex or Google listening to me all day collecting data, so I decided
                            to make my own.
                            This project uses Ollama for the LLM specifically running llama2-uncensored because why not!
                            When the program runs it listens for the set wake word and once it is picked up it lets you
                            know it is listening for a prompt.
                            Using OpenAi's whisper models your prompt is converted into text and then fed into the LLM.
                            The LLM then will start printing out text to let you know it is working.
                            Finally, once the LLM finishes its response the text is spoken to the user.

                        <p>
                            This is the first real project I ever made. I have a knack for robotics and thought it would
                            be cool to make my self a bed side display from an aurduino. I decided to use an esp35 for
                            this project due to ease of set up. For the display I wanted two things: a bible quote of
                            the day and the weather. At this time I used JSoup to scrape websites because I didn't APIs
                            at the time. So needless to say I decided to make this a lot harder than it needed to be!
                            To get the data I wanted I wrote a Spring Boot Java program then with JSoup scraped the data
                            I wanted from certain websites. I then deployed this app and started writing the arduino
                            code. So get this merry go round. Then I had my esp35 connect to the internet and JSoup the
                            super simple web app I made. Ok now here me out I did this because my esp35 didn't have
                            enough ram to JSoup bigger websites I was getting my data from. So after a lot of unecissary
                            suffering I got the little guy to work. While paying for a web app *Thumbs Up*.

                            The Jetson Nano is a proprietary single-board computer well-suited for local AI development.
                            I’ve completed numerous projects using this board. Due to limited equipment, I created a
                            full
                            persistent Ubuntu installation on a USB drive to flash the Nano from a Windows machine. I’ve
                            successfully run several local AI models on the board, and I’m currently working on exposing
                            these models remotely via a self-hosted server and a custom remote power control switch.
